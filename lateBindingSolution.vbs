Early Binding and Error Handling:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next 'Handle potential errors
Dim objExcel As Object
Set objExcel = GetObject(, "Excel.Application") 'Early binding, might still fail
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Excel is not running or could not be accessed. Error: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
  Err.Clear
  Exit Sub
End If
' ... use objExcel object ...
Set objExcel = Nothing
```
This improved version uses early binding by declaring `objExcel As Object`, and it includes error handling to gracefully handle situations where Excel isn't running or accessible.  `GetObject` is used for early binding when the application is already running; `CreateObject` is generally used for late binding and creating a new instance.  Always favor early binding when possible for better reliability and easier debugging.
